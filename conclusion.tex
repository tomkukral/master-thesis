I have analyzed and compared networking and storage technologies used in distributed (cloud) datacenters. Virtualization is mentioned in the beginning as an enabling technology for cloud computing. Cloud deployment and service model are compared and appropriate use cases are mentioned.

The biggest part is dedicated cloud computing, especially to networking, storage and orchestration technologies. Comparison is made by defining use cases and commenting advantages and disadvantages. It is not possible to rigorously decide on best solution because there is so many use cases and every use case require individual approach.

I have developed application called Themis. This application is capable to evaluate virtual machines availability during live migration. It combines network measurements, orchestration and data analysis.

% Fork

% elmag fork
Fork of the application is used in project Department of Electromagnetic Field. It is used for automatic measurement of wireless links and link monitoring. Migration routines are not used and a remote management is replaced by agent responsible for continuous packet generation. I am going to continue in development of this fork and new features will be merged into main branch.
