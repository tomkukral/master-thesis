Virtualization is, in my opinion, the most important technology in data centers. It is not technology itself, so it should be called model rather then technology. 

It all started in late 1960s as a request of sharing mainframe computers. There were same challenges as we are facing these days, because it was beneficial to be able to share resource of one computers between multiple users or tenants. Resource sharing brings possibility of operational costs sharing as well as better effectiveness caused by improved utilization. enefits and advantages or sharing resource are described at \ref{subsec:advantages-of-virtualization} Advantages of virtualization.
