We can find many services called \Uv{cloud based}, but do we really know what does it mean? It is quite clear, that cloud based service will use principle of cloud computing. Definition of cloud computing by \Ac{NIST} says, that \Uv{Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services) than can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provide interaction.} [TODO: cite NIST definition]. This definition clarifies what cloud computing is, but says nothing about parameters and used technologies.

I think, that it would be better to start definition from lower levels to upper and finally get to the cloud service. Basic part of cloud computing system is virtual machine (\Ac{VM}). Physical machine also can be part of the cloud system, but it is not able to deliver required rapid provisioning and also it is not possible to provision (deploy) physical machine without service provider interaction.




According to [TODO: citation of cloud usage], ladslfjadfadfasdfasfs. This means, that almost every service running at the Internet is located in cloud or it will happen in short period. 

First this we should think about is definition of service in cloud. [TODO: definition of server] Therefore cloud service is basically one or more virtual machines running some software, which provides the service. It can be said, that the cloud service is kind of abstraction of virtual machines providing the service and therefore service is equal to some set of virtual machines with suitable software.
