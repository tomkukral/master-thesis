We can find many services called \Uv{cloud based}, but do we really know what does it mean? It is quite clear, that cloud based service will use principle of cloud computing. Definition of cloud computing by \Ac{NIST} says, that \Uv{Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services) than can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provide interaction.} [TODO: cite NIST definition]. This definition clarifies what cloud computing is, but says nothing about parameters and used technologies.

I think, that it would be convenient to start definition from lower levels, which provided elementary parts, and get to the cloud service afterwards. Basic part of cloud computing system is virtual machine (\Ac{VM}). Physical machine also can be part of the cloud system, but it is not able to deliver required rapid provisioning and also it is not deploy physical machine without service provider interaction. Virtual machine is basic resource and also use some additional resource, it would usually be networking, storage and some configuration management. Just one \Ac{VM} can be considered cloud based, but it does not allow any scalability. Providing customers with just one \Ac{VM} should not be called cloud computing, but to my way of thinking it is only bare virtualization.


My definition gives different view of cloud computing, but it uses same conditions as \Ac{NIST}'s does and therefore we basically get same result.




According to [TODO: citation of cloud usage], ladslfjadfadfasdfasfs. This means, that almost every service running at the Internet is located in cloud or it will happen in short period. 

First this we should think about is definition of service in cloud. [TODO: definition of server] Therefore cloud service is basically one or more virtual machines running some software, which provides the service. It can be said, that the cloud service is kind of abstraction of virtual machines providing the service and therefore service is equal to some set of virtual machines with suitable software.
