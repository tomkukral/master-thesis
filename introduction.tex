%There is massive evolution of data center environment during last few years. Building small data centers for just one subject (tenant) was quite common in previous era and this data center was usually used only for single subject's services and it was under it's full control. 
%However this legacy way of building data center bring some mayor disadvantages and it is was clear, that this approach is going to be changed during the time.
%
%Convergence and consolidation came into data center's during recent period. It is beneficial to build larger data center for many tenants than building smaller data center for everyone of them. This approach is feasible thanks to virtualization, because it provides virtual computers, virtual services and even virtual data centers. These relative new virtualization possibilities gives an opportunity to build large data centers and massively share physical resources with virtualization techniques. Sharing resources between tenants brings better physical resources utilization and also helps to provide better environment for physical facility. It is possible to deploy more effective cooling techniques than in smaller data center.

%Data center virtualization and physical resource sharing brings some problems, which do not occur in traditional data center architecture. It is necessary to allow sharing of resources, but it is also required to provide sufficient tenant isolation and avoid interfering between them. Data network in data center should be flexible enough to fulfill all these requirements and must maintain sufficient level of security as well. Lets imagine simple example of data center with only a few tenants, each tenant uses it's own inter data center virtual network for communication between virtual machines. It is unacceptable for one tenant to see traffic of other tenant and it is also required to apply rules for physical resource sharing. One tenant mustn't be able to use all physical resources and thus limit other tenants. Collision of \Ac{IP} address in tenant's networks may occur in case of insufficient separation of their networks. Separation is necessary for allowing each tenant to use same pool of private \Ac{IP} address.
%
%Higher level of resource abstraction requires establishment of method for analysis and measurement of these resource. 
%
%Practical part of this thesis focus on virtual machine migration and defines framework for benchmarking of this migration. There are also presented results measured at OpenNebula cloud solution build at CTU Student Union facilities.
