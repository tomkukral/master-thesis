There are three scenarios possible for deploying cloud solutions. Models differs by ownership and subject responsible by administration of solution. Right solution depends on expected load, available budget as well as on expected classification of data. Public model and private model are mutually contradictory and last model called hybrid is combination of first two mentioned.

\subsubsection{Private}
Private model defines model with cloud environment is build exclusively for single subject. Typical scenario is to build private cloud in datacenter owner by the subject, but it is not strictly required. There is common misunderstanding of term private, because it means private usage of cloud resource and not private ownership of cloud infrastructure. Private cloud may be leased from third-party provider and it can also be running on third-party hardware.

Running private cloud gives an advantage in elimination of any inter-tenant isolation problems and it is possible to adapt configuration to fit owner needs. There is a law, which forces sensitive data to be stored internally and with limited access, so it is necessary to build private or hybrid cloud for this kind of usage. [TODO: cite]

Drawback of private cloud is higher initial cost and probably also higher operational costs, but it depends on expected usage.
