There are three different computer virtualization types and they vary by method used to add virtualization layer between guests and physical hardware. It it not possible to easily choose better or worse virtualization types because it depends on intended usage, character of computing tasks and required operating system.
 
Common computer architectures are designed to run on the physical harware, so is in not easy to virtualize these architectures. Access to hardware is controlled by priority levels called rings. Lowest priority is assigned to the userspace applications and highest priority (ring 0) is reserved for operating system. It is necessary to insert virtualization layer between operating system and hardware, but there is not any ring with higher priority than operating system uses. This problem needs to be solved and it is not the only one. There are sensitive instructions incompatible with virtualization because they use different semantics if they are not run in ring 0, as mentioned in \cite{vmware-para}.

\subsection{Paravirtualization}
Paravirtualization is type of virtualization with necessity of modifications in guest kernel. Modifications of kernel are necessary because operating system uses non-virtualizable instructions that are trying to gain direct access to the hardware. These instruction need to be replaced with hypercalls that communicate directly with virtualization layer of hypervisor. \cite{vmware-para} It is obvious, that guest operating system knows it is running virtualized. 

Biggest advantage of paravirtualization is lower overhead because is not necessary to translate instructions before running. However, this advantage becomes less significant because there are processors with hardware optimization for instruction translation. Main drawback of this type of virtualization is the need for operating system modifications, which are not always possible or allowed. Running modified \Ac{OS} also brings additional administration and additional cost.

It is possible to take a different look at paravirtualization and 
use operating system-level virtualization. It does not duplicate whole kernel for each virtual machine because tenants share same kernel and isolation is performed in userspace. These userspaces are called containers and therefore this approach is called container virtualization. It does not provide entire isolated virtual machine, but allows to run software packed in a container. It is advantageous because there is almost none overhead in running software from container while maintaining sufficient level of container isolation. Container virtualization is applicable in situation where entire virtual machine is not needed and where containers brings huge performance improvements since operating system layer is shared. Containers can be the next revolution in virtualization. For example Dustin Kirkland, Cloud Solutions Product Manager at Canonical wrote: \Uv{Linux containers, repositories of popular base images, snapshots using modern copy-on-write filesystem features.  Brilliant, yet so simple.  Docker.io for the win!} \cite{ubuntu-docker}. I think, that container virtualization may bring compelling advantages and I also like using it, but it is not suitable for every situation. It is still technically kind of paravirtualization and thus it is limited to provide only additional layer on host's operating system.

\subsection{Full virtualization}
Virtualization capable or running unmodified operating system is called full virtualization. It utilizes runtime translation, which captures non-virtualizable commands and emulates them using hypervisor virtualization layer. Virtualizable instructions are executed directly on the hardware. Modification of \Uv{problematic} calls is carried by the hypervisor which constitutes the main difference compared with paravirtualization. 

Most important benefit of full virtualization is running guest operating system without any changes, so guest \Ac{OS} is not aware of being virtualized. This makes guest operating system fully detached from underlaying hardware. It is possible to run different operating systems on a single host. This virtualization can be used to migrate operating system from physical machine to virtual machines because it it not necessary to make any changes to operating system. Drawback of full virtualization is overhead caused by catching and translating non-virtualizable calls. 

\subsection{Hardware assisted virtualization}
Full virtualization has significant overhead caused by binary translation, so \Ac{CPU} vendors introduced technologies capable of inserting virtualization layer between ring 0 and physical hardware. It speeds-up traps of privileged and sensitive calls and it is not necessary to perform binary translation or to modificate kernel of guest operating system. 

Benefit of this type is quite obvious because it lowers virtualization overhead and thus provides better performance compared with full virtualization together with elimination of guest kernel modifications compared with paravirtualization. It is necessary to have a support in host's \Ac{CPU} which is the primary drawback of this virtualization type. However hardware assisted virtualization is supported by almost every processor used for servers.

Running unmodified guest operating system leaves all necessary translations on hypervisor layer, but it may be better to introduce small changes to guest's operating system, which will reduce work left for the hypervisor, but at the same time limit changes done to guest's kernel. This approach is called hybrid virtualization and it is subset of hardware assisted virtualization. Installation of additional drivers is required, but it is not necessary to make any changes in a whole kernel. These drivers are aware of virtualization and use virtualization layer directly without any translations made by the hypervisor. This method increases driver's \Ac{IOPS} and therefore is usually used for virtualized network cards and storages. Driver able to deliver hybrid virtualization is \Name{virtio} for \Ac{KVM}, Xen call it \Name{paravirtualized device drivers} and VMWare  \Name{Guest Tools}.

\subsection{Summary}
General virtualization types were presented together with pros and cons. Universal virtualization type suitable for all use cases does not exists, thus is always possible to decide on planned usage. It also depends whether it is required to run different kernel on single physical host or it is sufficient to share one kernel for all containers. Differences are compared in table \ref{tab:virtualization-types}.

We can divide virtualization into two groups:
\begin{itemize}
	\item One group provides guests with full virtual machine, every \Ac{VM} uses it's own isolated kernel and \Ac{VM}s are fully decoupled from hardware. Full, hardware assisted and hybrid virtualization belongs to this group.
	\item Members of second group are containers and paravirtualization. This group is specific by lightweight containers and host kernel shared by all running containers.
\end{itemize}

Virtualization is massively used even by czech companies. First group is used for example by \Name{Wedos} for their virtual server hosting and related services. Second group is used by \Name{Seznam.cz} as they use \Ac{LXC} for web servers as well as for Hadoop cluster.
